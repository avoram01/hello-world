    <h1>A Brief Biography of Andrea Vorametsanti</h1>

    <p>I was born and raised in Millbrae, California, 30 minutes south of San Francisco. I grew up in the same house that I go home to visit each school vacation. I have a sister who is seven years older than me, so half of my childhood was spent as the tortured younger sibling, the other half as a spoiled only child. I attended public school in Millbrae until 2016 when I graduated from Mills High School. When applying for colleges during my senior year, I had no idea what I wanted to study, but I always had a fascination with the East Coast. Upon visiting Tufts, among other universities during the summer of 2015, I decided to apply to Tufts early decision and I got in!</p>
    
    <p>As of now, I still do not know what I want to major in here at Tufts. Originally, I came in as a "tentative Bio major" because I had liked studying the subject in high school. Ironically, I could not get into Bio13 as a freshman, so I took Comp11 instead and here I am in Comp20, one year later. I am leaning towards double majoring in Computer Science and Biotechnology, but who knows where I will be in a year from now.</p>

    <p>On campus I am involved with various culture clubs as well as Torn Ticket II, the student run theater group. I am also a peer leader for the Asian American Center. In my free time, I enjoy making playlists on Spotify and spending time in the sun.</p>
